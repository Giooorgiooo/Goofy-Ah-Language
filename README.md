# Goofy Ah Language

This is a simple Python project that creates a whimsical programming language and a Python translator for a playful and entertaining coding experience.

I thank all people that use this for their project. I love to contribute to the community. However, please credit me by using the GitHub project link.

## Usage

To use this program, you need python 3.6+.

### Write your own goofy script
1. Open the `main.goofy` file.
2. Start writing your program (learn the langauge below).
3. Run the `run.py` file.

Do not rename the `main.goofy` file.
